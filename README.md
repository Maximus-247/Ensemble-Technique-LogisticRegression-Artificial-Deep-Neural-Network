# Ensemble Technique: Logistic Regression & ADNN

## Overview

This project explores ensemble techniques combining Logistic Regression (LR) and Artificial Deep Neural Networks (ADNN) to improve classification accuracy. The goal is to leverage the strengths of both models—LR for interpretability and ADNN for deep feature extraction—to enhance predictive performance.

## Problem Statement

Standard machine learning models often face limitations in handling complex, high-dimensional data. Logistic Regression is simple but struggles with non-linearity, while deep neural networks (DNNs) require large amounts of data and computational power. This project investigates how an ensemble of these two approaches can yield higher accuracy and robustness.

## Objectives

1. Compare the performance of Logistic Regression and ADNN individually.

2. Develop an ensemble model that combines predictions from both techniques.

3. Evaluate the ensemble's performance using standard classification metrics.

4. Determine if the ensemble technique improves predictive accuracy compared to individual models.

## General Analysis of Results

1. Feature Engineering: Data preprocessing and transformation were performed to optimize input for both models.

2. Model Performance: ADNN showed higher accuracy but required more training time, while Logistic Regression was faster and interpretable.

3. Ensemble Results: The combined approach improved classification accuracy and reduced misclassification rates.

4. Evaluation Metrics: The ensemble model achieved the highest accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, outperforming individual models.

## Conclusion

By integrating Logistic Regression and ADNN, this project demonstrates how ensemble learning can enhance predictive performance and robustness. The results suggest that using a hybrid approach can mitigate the weaknesses of individual models and improve real-world decision-making.

## Recommendations

1. Optimize model hyperparameters for improved ensemble performance.

2. Incorporate additional features to enhance classification accuracy.

3. Experiment with other ensemble methods like stacking or boosting for comparison.

4. Deploy the model in real-world applications for further validation.
