There are several factors that explain why the stock markets throughout the world are connected in some way. Some of the factors are listed below:

1) The world's economies are interdependent. For instance, the two largest economies in the world are the United States and China. China is the United States' main trading partner, while China has several trading partners all over the world. China is the major supplier of goods to nations in Europe and Africa. Because of this global network, economies are interdependent. Hence, there will be a connection between the stock markets.
2) Currency connects global marketplaces. The leading currency in the world is the US dollar. Because of its hegemony, it has a significant impact on international markets. The dollar's fluctuation has a significant impact on other markets.
3) Several of the businesses are listed on more than one stock exchange. The same company listed on another stock market will be impacted when the price of one company changes.
4) Comparable businesses in the same sector may simultaneously get their ratings raised or lowered in several areas. The consequences of these valuations will be felt by other comparable companies in the same industry in different nations.
